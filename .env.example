# Azure Entra ID (Azure AD) Configuration
# Required for authentication in the Bifrost web interface
# Recommended to create a new App Registration for development so you don't need
# to add localhost to your production app registration redirect URIs
# Also used to access Key Vault locally, so you'll need to make this service principal a contributor to your vault.

ENTRA_CLIENT_ID=your-entra-id-app-client-id
ENTRA_CLIENT_SECRET=your-entra-id-app-client-secret

# Azure Key Vault URL (optional)
# Used for storing and retrieving secrets in workflows
# For a lot of people, you may want to use your production Key Vault to ensure secrets are consistent
# If you have a local/development setup for whatever services you integrate with, use a specific Key Vault instead
AZURE_KEY_VAULT_URL=https://your-vault-name.vault.azure.net/

# Used for Azure Web PubSub service
# Optional but recommended for real-time communication features, otherwise you'll be refreshing the page
# Free tier should be plenty for development and testing
WebPubSubConnectionString=your-azure-web-pubsub-connection-string

# Optional: Must be 1 with ENABLE_DEBUGGING=true to avoid debugpy port conflicts
# You'll notice with 1, the UI will lock  up sometimes when running long workflows, but it's
# normal for development when this is set to 1. In production, this won't matter because the service will scale out.
# FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1
# Website Auth Encryption Key (optional, has default)
# Used for encrypting session tokens
# You shouldn't be running this in production, so the default is probably fine
# Default: C0sm0Rk3y567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345
